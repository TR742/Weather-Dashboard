# Weather-Dashboard

About the project

The goal for this homework was to create a weather dashboard using multiple API calls. These API calls wil provide the user the current temp, wind speed, ect. for the city they provide. This information should save to local storage so the user can switch between city they have previously searched. Each city search should include the upcoming 5-day forecast.

User experience

When the user loads the page, they are presented with a clean website with a input field to search for cities across the United States. Once they input a city and click the search button, they are presented with the current temp, wind speed, humidity, and UV index along with a 5-day forecast for future dates. Previously seached cities information will be stored in local storage for the user to access by clicking the cities icon below the search bar.
